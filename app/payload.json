      "detailedBackground": "In the old days before the  PACS (Image servers for Radiological Images), clinicians would walk to Radiology film rooms to consult with Radiologists. Clinicians and radiologists used to spend lots of time together, discussing and interpreting medical Images. \n\nNowadays this face to face communication is virtually nonexistant. Radiological images becmome a formal written report that's signed and sent electronically.  As a result, Radiologists' productivity has increased—they're reading more and more cases every day but at a cost: \n\n Consults generally happen only after scheduling, and then usually happen over the phone where both parties have their image viewer open, trying their best to keep their screens in sync (there can be hundereds or thousands of images in a procedure).\n\n REACH solves these problems by reintroducing face to face contact through an iPad VoIP session. REACH has a search interface to find exams, an embedded clinical viewer that syncs between the people on the call, and an intuitive UI to make it easy to connect.",

      "detailedBackground": "Beginning clinical research requires the discovery of a 'cohort'—the subjets of your research. This is often performed via manual search through any number of data sources (e.g. PACS, RIS, EMR, billing systems, etc.) and manual entry into a generic spreadsheet. This cohort building / query process usually produces enormus numbers of data points, even for small studies of a few dozen or a few hundred patients. The Process is, therfore,  exceedingly time consuming and prone to human errors. \n The process of blinding data (for research integrity) and protecting patient identifiers (for ethical integrity) is also a burdensome, nonstandardized task that is subject to mistakes and noncompliance. \n\nOASIS attempts to solve these problems. OASIS is a robust software solution that automates these arduous tasks. Oasis provides a UI taylored towards ingesting and manipulating these 'cohorts.' Oasis allows a researcher to attach custom metadata to exams, and to annotate studies with state labels in order to track and document exclusion critiria.",

Additionally, the application will track the changes made to reports, allowing residents to easily and quickly see what changes were made to their reports.  The current solutions available for tracking workflow are each limited by speed and/or functionality.\nThe aim of this project is to create an easily accessible, lightweight, extensible interface for tracking reports and changes made to these reports as available through the RIS.  The open architecture created by this project could then later be integrated into other initiatives (such as the dashboard).",
