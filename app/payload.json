      "detailedBackground": "In the old days before PACS (Image servers for Radiological Images) existed, clinicians would go down to the Radiology film rooms to consult with Radiologists. Clinicians and radiologists used to spend a fair amount of time together, discussing and interpreting medical Images, providing consultation in real time without waiting for the final report from the radiology department.\nNowadays this face to face communication has diminished to non-existence with the advancement of RIS and PACS technologies, all radiological images and the generated reports are written, signed, and sent electronically.  As a result, Radiologists' productivity has increased, enabling them to read more and more cases every day; a radiologist goes through a worklist of radiology examinations every day. Because they see more cases per capta, their time has become more valuable. They are located in dark reading rooms, where clinicians rarely visit due to the geographical inconvenience dedicated reading rooms create. Though modern technological advances have increased turnaround time for radiology reports, communication and consults generally happen only after coordinating  between two stacked schedules, over phone while both parties have the image viewer open, both doing their best to always be looking at the same images (usually among many in a given procedure). They attempt to discuss the same artifacts on images while talking over the phone and there is no face to face contact. Organic interaction between clinicians and radiologists has almost disappeared. \nWe call this a form of “Signal Loss”: Analog phones do not do a good job of coordinate schedules, they also drop all visual feedback that humans use to communicate.",

      "detailedDescription": "Beginning clinical research requires the discovery of a 'cohort'. Finding subjects that match a given criteria and exluding those that match exclusion critiera, . This is often performed via manual search through any number of data sources (e.g. PACS, RIS, EMR, billing systems, etc.) and manual entry into a generic spreadsheet. The number of data points are often extremely large, even for small studies involving a few dozen or a few hundred patients, and such manual search and entry is therefore exceedingly time consuming and prone to human errors. Furthermore, manipulation of the dataset following the establishment of the cohort (i.e. during data entry) can result in errors and data loss, leading many researchers to save numerous different versions of their working dataset. The process of blinding data (for research integrity) and protecting patient identifiers (for ethical integrity) is also a burdensome, nonstandardized task that is subject to mistakes and noncompliance. \nA robust software solution that automates any of the above processes would save time and reduce human error. Furthermore, providing a customizable user interface in which to work would decrease errors when manipulating the dataset, allow easier collaboration between researchers, and save time given appropriate form design. Finally, robust data governance would decrease errors, allow more efficient error-discovery, and provide a safer means for multiple researchers to contribute to a single project.",

Additionally, the application will track the changes made to reports, allowing residents to easily and quickly see what changes were made to their reports.  The current solutions available for tracking workflow are each limited by speed and/or functionality.\nThe aim of this project is to create an easily accessible, lightweight, extensible interface for tracking reports and changes made to these reports as available through the RIS.  The open architecture created by this project could then later be integrated into other initiatives (such as the dashboard).",
